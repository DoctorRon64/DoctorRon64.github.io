            <p>Greetings! My name is Philip. I am a Dutch <span>&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F1;</span> college student following the game development program at the <a href="https://www.hku.nl/">HKU</a> (Utrecht University of the Arts).
                I'm incredibly passionate about making games, creating music, drawing art and exploring new skills and knowledge. I try to specialize in Architecture and Audio.

            <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
            <p><img src="/assets/img/icons/devicon--godot.svg" class="AboutIcon" width="24px" height="24px"> I  am eager to learn more about <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, an open-source game engine. Its open-source nature fascinates me because I appreciate the community-driven aspect and the cost-free access, which is especially important for me as a student.</p>
            <p>üè≠ I want to enhance my ability to structure code better and make it more efficient. I believe this is crucial for becoming a better developer, as well-organized and efficient code makes development easier for both myself and others.</p>
            <p>üéß I am very interested in audio and music, and I want to become better at composing music that sounds professional. I also want to learn more about <a href="https://www.fmod.com/">FMOD</a>, a powerful tool for integrating audio in Unity.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My dad once introduced me to the coding world only after I had learned how to 3D model in Blender. I thought,
                <div class="quote-section">
                    <blockquote>
                        "Wouldn't it be cool if I could use these models in a game?" 
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                That's how I discovered the world of game jams. I participated in one, and then another, and after the summer break, I had to decide what I should pursue in
                college. As my passion for music-making, coding, and art-related things grew, and I faced many struggles with coding
                games, I realized that my opportunity lay in game development. This would truly combine my passions, and that is the reason I started Game Development at the HKU in september 2022.

            <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>I draw inspiration from the stylish aesthetics of the 30s, envisioning big band scenes where everyone wears hats.
                    I'm particularly fascinated by games like <a href="https://cuphead.wiki.gg/wiki/Cuphead_Wiki">Cuphead</a> and manga like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family">Spy x Family</a>
                    for their captivating art styles reminiscent of the 30-50s era.<br>
