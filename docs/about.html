        Hello! My name is DrRon.
        I am a Dutch <span>&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F1;</span> game developer and am very passionate, creative, and love learning
        new things.
        I am currently in my second year of my game development program at <a href="https://www.hku.nl/">HKU</a> in
        Utrecht.
        I'm very inspired by games like <a href="https://cuphead.wiki.gg/wiki/Cuphead_Wiki">Cuphead</a> and anime like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family">Spy x Family</a>
        because of their 20th-century style. In my spare time, I enjoy composing music with FL Studio
        <iconify-icon icon="arcticons:fl-studio-mobile"></iconify-icon>
        and am trying to improve myself.
        <br> <br>
        As a coder, I'm always trying to improve readability and efficiency in my code. That's why I recently developed
        a strong interest in design patterns and aim to learn and improve more in that area.
        I have specialized in AI as I have created numerous state machines and behavior trees during my time at HKU.
        <br> <br>
        My dad introduced me to the coding world only after I had learned how to 3D model in Blender. I thought,
        "Wouldn't it be cool if I could use these models in a game?"
        That's how I discovered the world of game jams.
        I participated in one, and then another, and after the summer break, I had to decide what I should pursue in
        college.
        As my passion for music-making, coding, and art-related things grew, and I faced many struggles with coding
        games, I realized that my opportunity lay in game development.
